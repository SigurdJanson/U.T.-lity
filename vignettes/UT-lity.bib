  abstract     = {Ecological Models and Data in R is the first truly practical introduction to modern statistical methods for ecology. In step-by-step detail, the book teaches ecology graduate students and researchers everything they need to know in order to use maximum likelihood, information-theoretic, and Bayesian techniques to analyze their own data using the programming language R. Drawing on extensive experience teaching these techniques to graduate students in ecology, Benjamin Bolker shows how to choose among and construct statistical models for data, estimate their parameters and confidence limits, and interpret the results. The book also covers statistical frameworks, the philosophy of statistical modeling, and critical mathematical functions and probability distributions. It requires no programming background--only basic calculus and statistics.
	
- Practical, beginner-friendly introduction to modern statistical techniques for ecology using the programming language R
- Step-by-step instructions for fitting models to messy, real-world data
- Balanced view of different statistical approaches
- Wide coverage of techniques--from simple (distribution fitting) to complex (state-space modeling)
- Techniques for data manipulation and graphical display
- Companion Web site with data and R code for all examples},

Überprüfung:
"Bolker's book is a must-buy for anyone wanting to fit data to models
	and go beyond hypothesis testing, but it is certainly not an 'introductory'
	text in the sense of 'simple'. This book is a tour de force for anyone
	who studied ecology for his or her interest of nature's working.
	But it is the one single book that can propel the statistical novice
	to the cutting edge of statistical ecology--albeit with blood, sweat
	and tears."--Carsten F. Dormann, Basic and Applied Ecology
	
	
	"[A] must for natural scientists and for statisticians who are interested
	in ecological applications. . . . Numerous enlightening footnotes,
	meaningful graphics and direct speech are evidence of substantial
	classroom experience of the author. . . . The book addresses students
	and researchers who have or have had some basic knowledge in ecology,
	mathematics and statistics. Delivering many examples and profound
	details on numerical aspects of maximum likelihood estimation, the
	book may also give a red line for a course in computational statistics."--Martin
	Schlather, Biometrical Journal
	
	
	"[T]his book succeeds both in explaining how to analyze many types
	of ecological data, and in clearly describing the theoretical background
	behind some common analyses and approaches. I expect to refer to
	it often."--Lynda D. Prior, Austral Ecology},

  abstract = {A random sample is drawn from a population of animals of various species.
	(The theory may also be applied to studies of literary vocabulary,
	for example.) If a particular species is represented r times in the
	sample of size N, then r/N is not a good estimate of the population
	frequency, p, when r is small. Methods are given for estimating p,
	assuming virtually nothing about the underlying population. The estimates
	are expressed in terms of smoothed values of the numbers n, (r= 1,
	2, 3, ...), where n, is the number of distinct species that are each
	represented r times in the sample. (n, may be described as 'the frequency
	of the frequency r'.) Turing is acknowledged for the most interesting
	formula in this part of the work. An estimate of the proportion of
	the population represented by the species occurring in the sample
	is an immediate corollary. Estimates are made of measures of heterogeneity
	of the population, including Yule's 'characteristic'and Shannon's
	'entropy '. Methods are then discussed that do depend on assumptions
	about the underlying population. It is here that most work has been
	done by other writers. It is pointed out that a hypothesis can give
	a good fit to the numbers r~,but can give quite the wrong value for
	Yule's characteristic. An example of this is Fisher's fit to some
	data of Williams's on Macrolepidoptera.},
