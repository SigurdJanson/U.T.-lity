#' @describeIn estimatePOcc Estimating the visibility of events from a

#' Small samples 20 participants have a bias that can result in substantial

#'
#' @param p an non-adjusted estimate of the visibility of an event.
#' @param nSample the sample size.
#' @param Ntotal the total number of events (e.g. usability defects).
#' @param N1 the number of events occurring only once.
#' @param adj the adjustment technique. Either "GT" for a Good-Turing correction,
#' "defl" for the deflated adjustment, or "both" to return the average of both
#' correction methods (as recommended by Turner, 2006; Sauro & Lewis, 2012).
#'
#' @return Returns corrected values of `p`.
